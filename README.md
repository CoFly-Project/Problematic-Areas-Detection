# Problematic Areas Detection

<!-- This module detects problematic areas of a field and extracts their location based on a given vegetation index of the examined field region. As problematic are considered areas with lowest index values. -->

The main objective of this module is to detect problematic areas of a field and extract their geolocation based on the extracted vegetation indices of the [```Vegetation Indices```](https://github.com/CoFly-Project/Vegetation-Indices) module. As problematic are considered areas with the lowest index values and they are displayed with red color in VI maps. 

The results of the ```Problematic Areas Detection``` module are ```*.png``` and  ```*.json``` files (one for each vegetation index). The ```*.png``` files display the points of interest based on VI maps and the ```*.json``` files contain all the necessary information about the __*geolocation*__  of these points and the __*name of the nearest captured image*__ of the UAV.

  
## Dependencies 
Install all the neccecary dependencies using ```pip3 install <package name>```
  
Required packages:
  * opencv-python
  * numpy
  * scipy  
  * skimage
  * exif 
  * json
  * matplotlib
  * scikit-learn
  * gdal

## How to install [GDAL](https://gdal.org)
* On **Linux**, GDAL binary and Python binding are available through ubuntugis repository. 
  
```sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable```
  
```sudo apt-get install gdal-bin```
  
```sudo apt-get install python3-gdal```
  
  
* On **Windows**, the most easiest way to install GDAL Python Binding is to use the packages build by [Christoph Gohlke](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal). The ```*.whl``` package file contains a stand alone GDAL installation including all needed files (binaries, libraries, Python binding, etc.). After downloading the correct version of ```*.whl``` package based on the installed python version on the operating system, install the wheel file with the following command:

```
~PATH_TO_WHL_PACKAGE python.exe -m pip install GDAL-X.X.X-cpXX-cpXXm-win_amd64.whl
```
  
To finalize the installation, it's necessary to define a new Windows environment variables named GDAL_DATA pointing the directory ```C:\Program Files\GDAL\gdal-data``` and PROJ_LIB pointing ```C:\Program Files\GDAL\projlib```.

  
  
## How to run
  
1. Clone this repo
2. Open terminal on ~REPO_PATH
3. Run:
```
python3 areas_dection.py ~IMAGE_PATH ~PROJECT_PATH ~IMAGES_DIR_PATH
```
**ARGUMEŒùTS**
  
  * ```~IMAGE_PATH:``` corresponds to the absolute path of the input image of the examined area
  * ```~PROJECT_PATH:``` refers to the absolute path of the folder where the extracted results of the [__Vegetation Indices__](https://github.com/CoFly-Project/Vegetation-Indices) module are saved.
  * ```~IMAGES_DIR_PATH:``` refers to the absolute path of the folder which contains the collected images from the coverage mission of the UAV.
  
  
<!-- The ```~IMAGE_PATH``` corresponds to the absolute path of the input image and the ```~PROJECT_PATH``` to the absolute path of the folder where the extracted results of the ```Vegetation Indices''' module are saved. The ```~IMAGES_DIR_PATH``` refers to the absolute path of the folder which contains the collected images from the coverage mission of the UAV. -->
  
> Note: This module is based on the extracted ```*.npy``` files of [```Vegetation Indices```](https://github.com/CoFly-Project/Vegetation-Indices) module.
