# Problematic Areas Detection
  
The main objective of the ```Problematic-Areas-Detection``` module is to identify individual field regions of the examined area that present poor conditions, in terms of vegetation  health. Utilizing the indices arrays (```*.npy files```) extracted from the [```Vegetation-Indices```](https://github.com/CoFly-Project/Vegetation-Indices) module, a pixel-wise pipeline has been developed to detect the problematic regions. As problematic are considered areas where the corresponding index value is low. For every detected area, the  center of mass is calculated leading to a set of points, considered as points of interest. 


Τhe module takes as input the extracted VI array (npy file), the georeferenced stitched RGB image (tiff) and the path of the collected images (utilized for stitching). The output of the module is an image representation of the VI where the detected points of interest are annotated accordingly and a json file containing for each detected point the following information:

* the __*geolocation*__ of the point of interest
* the __*filename*__ of the image captured closest to it
  
The extracted files are named according to the corresponding VI, e.g. VARI.json. In Figure 1, we present the results of the ```Problametic Areas Detection``` module based on a given input RGB image in order to calculate the points of interest based on __*VARI index*__.

<!-- The results of the ```Problematic-Areas-Detection``` module are ```*.png``` and  ```*.json``` files (one for each vegetation index). The ```*.png``` files display the detected points of interest on VI maps and the ```*.json``` files contain all the necessary information about:
* the __*geolocation*__  of these points 
* and the __*name of the nearest captured UAV image*__. -->

## How to run
  
1. Clone this repo
2. Open terminal on ~REPO_PATH
3. Run:
```
python3 areas_dection.py --input_image ~IMAGE_PATH --project_path ~PROJECT_PATH --images_dir ~IMAGES_DIR_PATH
```
**ARGUMEΝTS**
  
  * ```~IMAGE_PATH:```  refers to the path of the input image of the examined area
  * ```~PROJECT_PATH:``` corresponds to the path of the extracted results from the [```Vegetation Indices```](https://github.com/CoFly-Project/Vegetation-Indices) module.
  * ```~IMAGES_DIR_PATH:``` refers to the path of the folder that contains the collected images from the coverage mission of the UAV.
  
> Note: From ~PROJECT_PATH only the __```*.npy```__ files of VIs are needed, as extracted from the __*Vegetation Indices*__ module. 
  
  
## Results
  
  * **Visualizations**

In Figure 2, we present the extracted results of this module for the four VIs.

## Dependencies 
Install all the neccecary dependencies using ```pip3 install <package name>```
  
Required packages:
  * opencv-python
  * numpy
  * scipy  
  * skimage
  * exif 
  * json
  * matplotlib
  * scikit-learn
  * gdal

**How to install [GDAL](https://gdal.org)**
* On **Linux**, GDAL binary and Python binding are available through ubuntugis repository. 
  
```sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable```
  
```sudo apt-get install gdal-bin```
  
```sudo apt-get install python3-gdal```
  
  
* On **Windows**, the most easiest way to install GDAL Python Binding is to use the packages build by [Christoph Gohlke](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal). The ```*.whl``` package file contains a stand alone GDAL installation including all needed files (binaries, libraries, Python binding, etc.). After downloading the correct version of ```*.whl``` package based on the installed python version on the operating system, install the wheel file with the following command:

```
~PATH_TO_WHL_PACKAGE python.exe -m pip install GDAL-X.X.X-cpXX-cpXXm-win_amd64.whl
```
  
To finalize the installation, it's necessary to define a new Windows environment variables named GDAL_DATA pointing the directory ```C:\Program Files\GDAL\gdal-data``` and PROJ_LIB pointing ```C:\Program Files\GDAL\projlib```.
